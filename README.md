## SenderEmail
# 

This is a simple but powerfull email simulator that implements different javascript technics as for example DOM Traversing and Delegation. In combitanation these allow us block buttons, make validations about form inputs and show messages of error and success. 

This project hasn't backend at this moment and it's not posible to send real emails but this funcionality will be addeed on the future.
